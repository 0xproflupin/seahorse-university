# Testing with Anchor

Although we've written the program, we have no clue if the logic works as expected.

We can test it using the Anchor framework. Don't worry, you won't require any Anchor expertise here, just some basic Javascript knowledge will do!

## Building our Program

Before we can start testing the program, we need to build it make Rust artifacts for our program which will be used in our Anchor tests.

Although we can to build the program locally using `seahorse build`, I will use this tutorial to introduce you to [Solana Playground](https://beta.solpg.io/)!
