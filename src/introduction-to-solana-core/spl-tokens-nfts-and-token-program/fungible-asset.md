# Fungible assets

Fungible assets are tokens that have:

1. `supply` &gt; 1
    
2. `decimal places` = 0
    

Having a supply greater than 1 but decimal places equal to 0 creates tokens that have very unique use-cases: gaming assets or utilities like a shield or a piece of wood. These assets with decimals equal to 0 can't be divided or fractionalised but are non-singular in supply, thus allowing distribution to a number of users.
