# Introduction to Solana

This tutorial is meant to be for a spectrum of readers:

1. Those experienced in the EVM space
    
2. Those new to web3
    
3. Non-developers
    

We will be going through some of the core concepts in Solana's architecture. These are basic building blocks for every action on this chain. The concepts we are going to discuss are not only beneficial to understand for aspiring developers but also for end users to make the most out of the experience of fast and cheap transactions on Solana.

Let us start with understanding how to read data on-chain. This will give us more context for the theoretical concepts we discuss later.
