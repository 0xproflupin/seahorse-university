## Chapter 1: On-Hands Introduction to Seahorse Lang: Poll App
The main focus of this Chapter will be to dive straight into the writing a Seahorse program without getting into the nitty-gritties of installing CLIs and dependancies. We will be using Solana Playground to write, test and publish our Seahorse Program. We will also write Anchor tests for our program and finally write a frontend in ReactJS.

We will focus on learning the very basics of Solana Core Programming.

## Chapter 2: On-Hands Introduction to Seahorse Lang: Counter App
In this chapter we will learn how to build a Counter App, and use Program Derived Addresses (PDAs) to do so. The program is similar to the above, but the use of PDAs opens up a new paradigm to the learners which is crucial for Solana Programming.
