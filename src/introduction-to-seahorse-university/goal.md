# Goal

## What we want to achieve with this course

Python is one of the most highly used languages worldwide for intro to programming courses. Due to the high popularity of Data Science and AI in recent years, there has been a significant increase in the number of Python developers. Web 3.0 is still inaccessible to these developers due to systems languages like Rust, and C is more famous for coding contracts on-chain.

The goal of this course should be to make Solana development accessible to relatively inexperienced developers and strictly act as a starting point to gauge interest and explore this new world of blockchain and decentralization.

The ultimate goal would be to see Solana projects being part of Intro to Programming courses at universities worldwide. This course could act as a starting point to build decentralized full-stack dapps on Solana.
