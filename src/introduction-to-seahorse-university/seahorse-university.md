# Introduction to Seahorse University

A path to becoming a program (smart-contract) developer on Solana for Python developers. You don't need any degree or web 3.0 experience.

## About this course
This course provides an introduction to the uninitiated in web3 to Solana development. Solana development has a steep learning curve because:

1. Solana Programming Model: Solana account model is not for the faint hearted. But once one gets the hang of it, itâ€™s one of the most excited frameworks to work with.
2. Rust Lang: the language used to code programs or smart contracts on Solana. Rust is not the easiest language to learn.
Seahorse lang is built to bypass one of these two barriers, more specifically the latter.

Developers gain Python's ease-of-use, while still having the same safety guarantees as every Rust program on the Solana chain. Low-level memory problems are handled by default, letting you worry about the important stuff.

## What you'll learn
- [x] Gain an immersive understanding of the Solana account model
- [x] Understand how to write Solana programs using Python and Seahorse lang
- [x] Learn how to make full-stack decentralised applications using Python and Typescript
- [x] Learn the very basics of Anchor and Rust using Seahorse lang

## Prerequisites
* Python programming skills
* Basics knowledge of Blockchain technology
